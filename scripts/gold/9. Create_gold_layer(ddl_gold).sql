DDL Script: Create Gold views

Script Purpose:
	- This script creates the views for the 'gold' layer in the data warehouse.
	- Why do we create a view instead of a table? To save space, to show the most recent data from the Silver layer and because a view is easier to modify than a table.
	- For every dimension, a surrogate key will be created. Surrogate keys are important because business keys
	 (product_id,customer_id) can change over time in the source system.
	- The data from the 'silver' layer will be used to create this layer.
	- Data transformations and combinations will be performed to produce clean and ready-for-analysis data.
	- By joining different tables two dimensions (dim_customer, dim_products) and a fact table (fact_sales) 
	 will be created (see Integration Model, Data Model, and Data Flow graphics).
